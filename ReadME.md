## Documentation for Business Card

This is my first website I have created in this software. I wanted my business card to be more on the simple side with neutral tones that are more apealing to the eye. I leanred alot bout html coding and also learned to be patient with the software and go slow for better results. While all projects are unique to everyone and fit who they are as an artist, I think my project stands out because it is neat and simple but still represents myself as an artist. There were two fonts used for the whole card, "Be Vietnam" and "Barlow Semi Condensed". These fonts fit the style I was going for in a playful but proffesional way. My contact information is linked to each website. I have not done any personal branding before so I started fresh and created some logo ideas in illustrator then moved to figma for the whole card mock up.
